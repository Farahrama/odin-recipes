    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>2 cups whole milk, or as needed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>24 ounces extra-sharp yellow Cheddar cheese, cubed</li>
        <li>16 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese, cubed</li>
        <li>2 pounds elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 pounds shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup seasoned breadcrumbs (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a large casserole dish.</li>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add milk, bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to
            low. Mix flour with 2 to 3 tablespoons water until smooth. Add flour mixture to the saucepan, stirring
            constantly, and cook until sauce thickens. Add cubed extra-sharp Cheddar and cubed sharp Cheddar cheese,
            stirring until cheese melts. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, and cook elbow macaroni until al dente (tender with
            a bite), about 8 minutes, or according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a microwave-safe bowl on High, about 10 seconds. In a large bowl,
            combine elbow macaroni, melted butter, and eggs. Stir in cheese sauce; adding a little more milk if the
            sauce seems too thick. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Pour macaroni and cheese into the prepared casserole dish. Top with shredded cheese and seasoned
            breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden-brown and bubbling, 35 to 45 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
